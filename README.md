# Daily Data Practice

This repository contains small, daily and weekly data analysis exercises focused on building consistency, strengthening core analytics skills, and documenting continuous improvement.

The work here reflects hands-on practice with real-world–style datasets and practical problem-solving approaches commonly used in data analytics roles.

### What You'll Find
- Excel data cleaning, transformation, and reporting tasks
- SQL query practice for analysis and aggregation
- Python exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Short notes, observations, and learnings from each exercise

Projects are intentionally scoped to be small and iterative.
Some work may be experimental, with a focus on learning, refinement, and progress over time.
